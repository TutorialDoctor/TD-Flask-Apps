It seems the main difference to note between developing a Web API and a Web App is that when a request is made to an API endpoint, data is returned. When a request is made to a Web App endpoint, html is returned.

The `index()` function returns a webpage.

The `show_people()` and `show_person(id)` functions return data in JSON format.
